# PhotonChopper-Lab
PhotonChopper‑Lab turns a corrugated‑ring aesthetic into a rigid, balanced slotted rotor for a modern Fizeau experiment. A low‑power laser passes through a gap in the spinning wheel, travels to a distant mirror, and is blocked on return at specific RPM “extinctions.” The repo provides a parametric OpenSCAD rotor, Arduino firmware that streams RPM .
